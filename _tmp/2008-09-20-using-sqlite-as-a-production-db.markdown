I wanted to use sqlite3 as my production DB for a <a href="http://github.com/csexton/cookbook/tree/master">little web app</a> that I am working on. Â Wasn't sure exactly what was going to be needed, but turns out if you add the following to your cap recipie you are all set. Shiny!

    task :after_update_code do
      run "ln -s #{deploy_to}/#{shared_dir}/db/production.sqlite3 #{current_release}/db/production.sqlite3"
    end

You might notice I am using bort as the starting point for cookbook.  They really have done everything I need, in the way I need. Since I am using it with Dreamhost (read: Passenger) and git I really didn't need to undo ANYTHING.
