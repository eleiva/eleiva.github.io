I've been tinkering with git, and git-svn.  Starting to figure out how to cope, and am hopeful that the real coolness of distributed systems will become apparent soon.

The real trick, was finally getting it to install with the options I had hoped for: svn integration, command completion and a custom bash prompt.

First, to install it via Mac Ports (other articles I read had either "+svn" or "+ bash_completion", but not both)

    sudo port install git-core +bash_completion +svn +doc

Set up <a href="http://unboundimagination.com/Current-Git-Branch-in-Bash-Prompt">Arya Asemanfar's</a> bash prompt and add git command completion.

I added the following to .bash_login

    # Command Completion
    source /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git
    # Custom Prompt
    parse_git_branch() {
      git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^\*]/d' -e 's/\* \(.\*\)/(git::\1)/'
    }
    parse_svn_branch() {
      parse_svn_url | sed -e 's#^'"$(parse_svn_repository_root)"'##g' | awk -F / '{print "(svn::"$1 "/" $2 ")"}'
    }
    parse_svn_url() {
      svn info 2>/dev/null | grep -e '^URL\*' | sed -e 's#^URL: \*\(.\*\)#\1#g '
    }
    parse_svn_repository_root() {
      svn info 2>/dev/null | grep -e '^Repository Root:\*' | sed -e 's#^Repository Root: \*\(.\*\)#\1\/#g '
    }
    export PS1="\[\033[00m\]\u@\h:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[31m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\$(parse_svn_branch)\[\033[00m\]$\[\033[00m\] "


Once you get to that point, I recommend heading over to <a href="http://www.intridea.com/2008/6/18/going-rogue-with-git-svn-on-os-x">Intridea's</a> Getting Rogue with git-svn, it has been a great help for me.
