title: Top 10 Mac apps for non-programmers
---


Recently a project manager friend of mine asked what he should get for his shiney new mack book pro, and I came up with the following list. Turns out it was 10 items long. So I was obligated by the internets to turn it into a blog post. 

1. [Adium](http://adium.im/) for chat (for when you don't care about video)

1. [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) commercial, for starting apps/switching/everything. TOTALLY worth the money. If you only buy one program for your mac buy this one.  If you cant cough up the euros at least use [QuickSilver](http://www.blacktree.com/).

1. [Tweetie for twitter](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/) best twitter client, just use the free version.

1. [Mac RDC client](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx) For those who need to remote into windows machines, but
this does it.

1. [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) is screen capture and markup on steroids. Alghough I am biased to [Captured]( http://github.com/csexton/captured), which is for programmers, so it does not fit the criteria. 

1. [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) who doesn't need an ftp client?

1. [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password) commercial, but by far the best password manager/form filler out there.

1. [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) simple sync between computers, does great job with [1Password's keychain](http://lifehacker.com/5063176/how-to-use-dropbox-as-the-ultimate-password-syncer).

1. [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/) commercial, but has a knack of making visio look tard-tastic.

1. [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) commercial, but it is a fantastic GTD program. the WebDAV sync lets me keep my todo list up-to-date on multiple devices.
