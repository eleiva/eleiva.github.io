title: Resolve .local domains in Ubuntu
---

Recently had a problem where i couldn't resolve any of our internal ".local" domain names.  The weird thing was I could add a dns search to resolve.conf and resolve it by pinging the host name, but anytime I tried to use the fdqn it would fail

Turns out the problem is the avahi-daemon. This can be disabled by editing

	/etc/defaults/avahi-daemon

and changing the AVAHI_DAEMON_START  to 0.

Then you can remove the rc scripts with the following command:

	sudo update-rc.d -f avahi-daemon remove
